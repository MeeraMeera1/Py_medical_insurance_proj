# U.S Medical Insurance Costs 

In this project, I will investigate a csv file with medical insurance costs using Python fundamentals. It is my hope that with this project I will analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.
